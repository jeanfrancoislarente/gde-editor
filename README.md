# How do I install it?

Make a new tampermonkey script with this src code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjzflynnbx/gde-editor/main/tampermonkey-script.js

After that - you need to be in debug mode in the Sitecore CDP app.

To enable debug mode append "&debug=true" to the URL and refresh.

That's it you're ready to go.

# How do I use it?

It's very simple. Watch this 2 minute video:
